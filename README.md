Use __Wordpress__ as ***Android Application*** __Back-end__

For this we use __two plugin__ and install them on our __wordpress website__.

# ***First Plugin :***

[FirstPlugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/rest-api/)

# ***Second Plugin :***

[secondPlugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/rest-api-filter-fields/)


NOTE:Some Application Nedd To another Api , So Need To another Plugins.


To find out how to install these plugins, see this [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXM1QgMODW0)

Once you have installed the plugins, you must have one such link to the API from your site.

                                 https://your domin /wp-json/wp/v2/posts?_embed
                                 
For Example This is for [my website](https://sanaebadi.info/wp-json/wp/v2/posts?_embed)
